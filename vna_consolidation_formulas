' this workbook is designed to help users consolidate only a certain portion of bins rather than completely emptying them.  This saved a lot of time for TNS HV retrofit at BOS7
' user pastes consolidation recommendations, which consist of 5 columns (ID, bin, sku, quantity, and volume), into this sheet
' and then they press a button and Excel calculates which picks they need to drop in order to clear a certain (user-defined) percentage of the inventory volume from each bin
